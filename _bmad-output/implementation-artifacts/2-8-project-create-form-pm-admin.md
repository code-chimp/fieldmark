# Story 2.8: Project create form (PM/Admin)

Status: ready-for-dev

Epic: 2 — Project Lifecycle & Compliance Dashboard
Source AC: [_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/epics/epic-2-project-lifecycle-compliance-dashboard.md](../planning-artifacts/epics/epic-2-project-lifecycle-compliance-dashboard.md) §Story 2.8
Canonical DDL: [docker/postgres/init/010_domain_tables.sql:58–95](../../docker/postgres/init/010_domain_tables.sql)
Depends on: Story 2.1 (Project / JobSite / ProjectTradeScope / ProjectInspector mappings + `domain` schema wiring; status: done), Story 2.2 (`AuditEntry` + per-stack `append_audit_entry()` helper + `ProjectCreated` in the canonical audit-action vocabulary at [docs/reference/audit-actions.md](../../docs/reference/audit-actions.md); status: done), Story 1.11 (login + return-target convention; the login redirect after unauth lands here for new sessions), Story 1.12 (`can()` primitive + ActionButton trichotomy — this story is the **first consumer** of `project.create` permission; status: done). Story 2.4 (InlineAlert wrapper — used for the top-of-form 422 alert; status: ready-for-dev — this story may consume the wrapper if 2.4 lands first, otherwise inline the InlineAlert markup matching the canonical from `fieldmark_shared/components/inline_alert/canonical.html` and refactor later).

## Story

As a Project Manager or Administrator (initially ADMIN — per Story 1.12 the `project.create` permission is granted to ADMIN only in MVP),
I want a Project-create form at `GET /projects/new` and a write endpoint at `POST /projects/` that — on valid input — performs a single transaction (load refs → `Project.create(...)` entity method → write `domain.project` + `domain.project_trade_scope` + `domain.project_inspector` + `domain.audit_entry` with `action="ProjectCreated"`) and HTMX-redirects to `/projects/<id>`,
So that the application has Projects to manage and the canonical create-flow contract — including the 422-renders-in-place validation pattern (UX Pattern 3), the audit-on-every-mutation rule (FR39 / FR57), the `aria-invalid + aria-describedby` form-error wiring (FR61 / UX-DR34), the `ProjectCreated` audit-action emission, and the cross-stack form-field-name + return-target conventions (per root [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md) §"Form-contract corollary") — is locked in for downstream create-flows (Story 3.4 `InspectionScheduled`, 4.4 `ViolationAssigned`, 5.2 `CorrectiveActionSubmitted`).

**Scope boundary:** this story produces, per stack: (a) `GET /projects/new` route + handler + Razor page / Django template / Go template rendering the form, (b) `POST /projects/` route + handler validating input, calling the `Project.create(...)` entity method, persisting four row writes (`project` + trade-scope joins + inspector joins + audit entry) inside one transaction, and responding `HX-Redirect: /projects/<id>` on success or 422 with the re-rendered form on validation failure, (c) the `Project.create(...)` **domain entity method** on each stack's `Project` type (the first behavior method on `Project` — Story 2.1 created the property bag with no methods), (d) the `project.create` permission grant for `ADMIN` wired into each stack's `can()` primitive from Story 1.12, (e) the canonical form-field-name contract documented at `docs/reference/project-create-form-contract.md` (NEW — per the root CLAUDE.md §"Form-contract corollary" requirement that cross-stack forms have a contract doc), (f) per-stack tests covering happy-path, 422 validation, 403 unauthorized, 405 (or framework-equivalent) on method mismatch, code-uniqueness conflict, audit-row presence, and idempotency under concurrent submission, (g) one Playwright E2E happy-path scenario per stack proving the cross-stack interaction is observably identical. **Out of scope:** the Compliance Dashboard's "New Project" ActionButton entry point (Story 2.10 — wires this story's route into the dashboard's empty-state CTA), the Project Detail screen the redirect lands on (Story 2.11 — must exist as at least a stub `GET /projects/<id>` returning an empty page before this story can E2E-verify the redirect; if 2.11 is not yet implemented at story-execution time, ship a **minimal stub** `GET /projects/<id>` returning `<main><h1>{{name}}</h1></main>` and document in the story sign-off that the stub will be replaced by 2.11 — do NOT block this story on 2.11), inspector-user discovery beyond the seeded dev users from Story 1.10 (the multi-select is populated from `auth.user` rows that have the conceptual `INSPECTOR` role; this story reads them but does not introduce user-management UI), any "edit project" flow (write-once create only in MVP), trade-scope or inspector-assignment **changes** after creation (out of scope for MVP), client-side validation (per UX-DR — server is the validator; the form ships with NO JS this story), file uploads or rich-text descriptions (the `description` field is a plain `<textarea>`), the **Compliance Dashboard tile** showing "Active Projects" count (Story 2.10), AG Grid (Story 2.9), and the form's ActionButton trichotomy for the **submit button** (the submit button is a plain `<button type="submit">` because the trichotomy is about *whether to render an action affordance*, not about form-submit semantics — see Dev Notes §"ActionButton vs form-submit boundary").

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1 — Cross-stack form-field-name contract at `docs/reference/project-create-form-contract.md` (NEW)

**Given** the Cross-Stack Architecture Principle and the root [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md) §"Form-contract corollary" ("when a form appears in ≥2 stacks (login, project-create, place-on-hold, corrective-action submit), the canonical field names, hidden-input names, and return-target conventions must appear in the story AC list or in a contract doc")
**When** I inspect `docs/reference/project-create-form-contract.md`
**Then** the file is **NEW** and contains, in this fixed order:

1. **Status block** — "populated by Story 2.8, 2026-05-28" mirroring [docs/reference/audit-actions.md](../../docs/reference/audit-actions.md).
2. **Why pointer** — reference to the root CLAUDE.md §"Form-contract corollary" and the Epic 1 retro 2026-05-25 finding that triggered the form-contract rule (login open-redirect, cookie regex).
3. **Routes** — `GET /projects/new` (render form) and `POST /projects/` (submit). Note the **trailing slash on POST** is deliberate and matches the epic AC ("POST /projects/" with slash) and the canonical Django idiom; .NET and Go routes must accept the trailing-slash form **and** the no-slash form is acceptable (frameworks differ); the canonical advertised URL in the form action is the trailing-slash form. Per-stack handler MUST not 308-redirect — accept both forms in place to avoid an unnecessary round-trip.
4. **HTTP-method matrix** — `GET /projects/new` returns 200 (form); `POST /projects/` returns either 422 (validation) or 200 with `HX-Redirect: /projects/<id>` header (success); `POST /projects/new` returns 405 (or framework-equivalent — see §HTTP-method-matrix below); `GET /projects/` is **not** introduced by this story (the project list at `/projects` is Story 2.9; do not preemptively register the route here).
5. **Form-field name list** — every `<input>` / `<select>` / `<textarea>` `name` attribute. Per-stack handlers MUST bind to these exact names. Listed in DOM order:

   | Field name | HTML element | Required | Type | Constraints |
   |---|---|---|---|---|
   | `code` | `<input type="text">` | yes | string | trimmed; non-empty; max 32 chars (matches `domain.project.code VARCHAR(32)`); unique across all projects (case-sensitive — DDL is case-sensitive `UNIQUE`); pattern `^[A-Z0-9][A-Z0-9-]*$` (uppercase alphanumeric + hyphen, must start with alphanumeric — see Dev Notes §"Code allowlist rationale") |
   | `name` | `<input type="text">` | yes | string | trimmed; non-empty; max 200 chars (matches DDL `VARCHAR(200)`) |
   | `description` | `<textarea>` | no | string | trimmed; max 10000 chars (DDL is `TEXT`, unbounded — the 10000 cap is the application-level guard) |
   | `start_date` | `<input type="date">` | yes | ISO date (YYYY-MM-DD) | must parse; no constraint on past/future |
   | `target_completion_date` | `<input type="date">` | no | ISO date | if provided, must be `>= start_date` |
   | `trade_scope_ids` | `<select multiple>` (or repeated `<input type="checkbox" name="trade_scope_ids">`) | yes | list of UUIDs | at least one selection required; each UUID must exist in `domain.trade_type` with `active=true` |
   | `inspector_ids` | `<select multiple>` (or repeated `<input type="checkbox" name="inspector_ids">`) | no | list of UUIDs | empty is allowed; each UUID must exist as a user with the `INSPECTOR` conceptual role (per Story 1.12 role-grant table) and be active |

   **The element shape is per-stack idiomatic** — Django and .NET both prefer `<select multiple>` with `<option value="<uuid>">`; Go's `html/template` may render either. Snapshot tests assert the rendered form contains an element bearing the canonical `name` attribute — they do NOT assert `<select multiple>` vs `<input type="checkbox">` at the byte level (this is form-shape latitude per stack; see Dev Notes §"Snapshot-test latitude for forms").

6. **Hidden-input list** — only the per-stack CSRF / antiforgery token (`__RequestVerificationToken` for .NET, `csrfmiddlewaretoken` for Django, none for Go per ADR-012 documented exemption). The form does **not** carry a `return_url` hidden input — this is a create flow, not a login flow; the redirect target is server-decided (`HX-Redirect: /projects/<id>`).
7. **Return-target convention** — the form's success response uses **`HX-Redirect`** (HTMX response header that triggers a full-page navigation via `window.location`), NOT `hx-target` partial swap. The redirect target is `/projects/<new-project-id>` (the Project Detail screen). Rationale: a brand-new entity has no partial container on the current page — full navigation is the honest signal. Story 2.10's Compliance Dashboard ActionButton fires this form via `hx-get="/projects/new"` into a modal-or-page (TBD by 2.10; this story does not own that choice). On success, `HX-Redirect` works regardless of how 2.10 mounts the form.
8. **422 response body shape** — the response is the **re-rendered form partial** with current values pre-filled (failed input echoed back; failed UUIDs gracefully de-selected with an inline error), an `InlineAlert` block at the top (`role="alert"`, severity `danger`, title `"Couldn't create the project"`, message lists field-level errors in DOM order — matching UX-DR §"Form validation announcement" at [ux-design-specification.md:1227](../planning-artifacts/ux-design-specification.md)), and `aria-invalid="true"` + `aria-describedby="<field-id>-error"` on each invalid field paired with an inline `<p id="<field-id>-error" class="form-error">...</p>` sibling. **HTTP status is 422 Unprocessable Entity** — not 400, not 200-with-error-flag.
9. **403 response body shape** — when the requester lacks `project.create`, **both** `GET /projects/new` and `POST /projects/` return HTTP 403 with the canonical 403 page (introduced by Story 1.11 — match its shape; if Story 1.11's 403 is a plain template, reuse it; do not invent a 403 page this story). **No state leakage** (FR7): the 403 body must not enumerate field names, UUIDs from the DB, or any signal that a 403-on-`/projects/new` is more interesting than a 403 on any other URL — a per-stack test asserts the 403 body for an unauthorized user is byte-equal to the canonical 403 body from Story 1.11.
10. **HTTP-method matrix detail.** Different frameworks render method-mismatch differently:
    - **.NET Razor Pages**: a POST handler with a `[HttpPost]`-bound handler method, called via GET, will route-fail and return 404 by default — this is the wrong answer. Wire the page model so a GET to `/projects/` (the bare collection URL) explicitly returns **405 Method Not Allowed** with `Allow: POST` header. .NET does not have a path-only POST endpoint; it has a `ProjectsCreate.cshtml.cs` PageModel whose only handler method is `OnPostAsync`. To produce 405 on GET against the collection URL, register a fallback page handler at the page model with an `OnGetAsync` that explicitly returns `StatusCode(405)` with `Response.Headers.Allow = "POST"`. Alternative: use a minimal-API endpoint `MapPost("/projects/", ...)` and let MVC return 405 natively — but this story uses Razor Pages for consistency with the rest of the .NET stack.
    - **Django**: a view function with `require_http_methods(["POST"])` decorator returns 405 natively with the `Allow` header. Use this.
    - **Go/Fiber**: `app.Post("/projects/", ...)` will return 405 on GET if `app.Get` is not registered for the same path — Fiber's default 405 response is acceptable.
    A per-stack test asserts a GET to `/projects/` returns 405 with `Allow: POST` (or the framework-equivalent header — Django and Fiber both emit `Allow`). The test must assert the header presence; do not let a 404 silently pass for 405.
11. **Audit-emission contract** — every successful `POST /projects/` write a single `domain.audit_entry` row with: `action="ProjectCreated"`, `actor_id=<request user id>`, `entity_type="Project"`, `entity_id=<new project id>`, `project_id=<new project id>` (denormalization — the project IS the project), `before_state=NULL`, `after_state=<JSON snapshot of project + trade scope + inspector lists>`, `metadata=NULL`. The `after_state` JSON schema is specified in section 12 below.
12. **`after_state` JSON schema for ProjectCreated** — bytes-stable across stacks via alphabetical key ordering:
    ```json
    {
      "code": "<code>",
      "compliance_score": 100,
      "description": null,
      "inspector_ids": ["<uuid>", "..."],
      "name": "<name>",
      "start_date": "<YYYY-MM-DD>",
      "status": "Active",
      "target_completion_date": null,
      "trade_scope_ids": ["<uuid>", "..."]
    }
    ```
    Keys are alphabetical; `null` fields are present (not omitted) for snapshot stability; UUID lists are sorted lexically (so two stacks creating identical projects produce byte-identical `after_state`). `compliance_score: 100` is the DDL default — record it in the snapshot explicitly so downstream review can see "this was a fresh project at score 100". `status: "Active"` is the seeded initial state (the `Project.create(...)` entity method always returns `status=Active`). The per-stack JSON serializer must emit alphabetical key order — see Story 2.4 Dev Notes §"JSON before/after disclosure" for the canonical resolution.
13. **Change Procedure** — adding a field or changing a field name follows the same procedure as `docs/reference/audit-actions.md`: ADR amendment in the epic file + this doc + three per-stack handler updates + three per-stack snapshot/form-binding tests + green `make parity`.

**And** the bottom of each per-stack handler file (and the Razor page template / Django template / Go template) has a top-of-file comment referencing this document URL.

### AC2 — `GET /projects/new` renders the form

**Given** I am authenticated as a user with `project.create` permission (initially `ADMIN` only — per Story 1.12 the permission grant for `project.create` is wired in this story; before the wire-up the role table from 1.12 does not include the permission)
**When** I navigate to `GET /projects/new`
**Then** each stack renders an HTML page containing:

1. A `<form method="post" action="/projects/">` (note trailing slash) with `hx-post="/projects/"`, `hx-target="this"` (so 422 re-renders into the form's own container), `hx-swap="outerHTML"`, and `hx-disabled-elt="find button[type=submit]"`. The form **also** functions without JS — the `method` and `action` attributes are the no-JS fallback; HTMX progressively-enhances.
2. The seven canonical fields per AC1 §form-field-name-list, in DOM order, each with:
   - A `<label for="<field-id>">` paired by `id`,
   - The `<input>` / `<select>` / `<textarea>` element with the canonical `name` attribute and an `id` matching the label's `for`,
   - Required fields have `required` attribute (HTML5 client-side guard — server-side validation is still authoritative per FR54 / UX-DR; the `required` attribute is a redundant safety net that costs nothing),
   - Date fields use `<input type="date">` (HTML5 native date picker — no JS calendar widget),
   - Trade-scope and inspector multi-selects render with the live data from each stack's reference-data read API (Story 2.3 — these endpoints are `done` per sprint status; this story consumes them).
3. The per-stack CSRF / antiforgery hidden input (`__RequestVerificationToken` for .NET / `csrfmiddlewaretoken` for Django; Go has no CSRF middleware yet per ADR-012 — match the same posture as the login form from Story 1.11).
4. A submit button: `<button type="submit">Create Project</button>` — plain Basecoat button, no `ActionButton` wrapper (see Dev Notes §"ActionButton vs form-submit boundary").
5. A Cancel link `<a href="/projects">Cancel</a>` (returns the user to the project list / dashboard; the project list at `/projects` is Story 2.9 — if not yet implemented, `<a href="/">Cancel</a>` to the dashboard is acceptable; coordinate with what exists at story-execution time).

**And** the form's accessibility contract is satisfied (FR60, FR61, FR62, UX-DR34):
- Every input has an associated `<label>`.
- Tab order matches DOM order matches visual order.
- Required fields are marked with both `required` and a visible asterisk-or-text indicator (`<span class="form-required" aria-hidden="true">*</span>` — the asterisk is decorative; `required` is the accessible signal).
- The form heading is `<h1>Create Project</h1>` (one per page per UX-DR33 strict heading rule).

**And** the page is otherwise the standard FieldMark base-layout chrome (Story 1.5 — header, main, FlashRegion, footer). No new chrome introduced this story.

### AC3 — `POST /projects/` happy path: single transaction, audit row, redirect

**Given** I am authenticated with `project.create` permission and I submit valid form input
**When** the request hits the handler
**Then** **exactly one transaction** opens against the `domain` schema, and inside that transaction:

1. **Load reference data** for validation: `SELECT id FROM domain.trade_type WHERE id = ANY($1) AND active = true` returns rows whose count must equal the submitted `trade_scope_ids` count (mismatch → validation failure, see AC4); similarly the inspector IDs (where the lookup hits each stack's `auth.user`-equivalent and filters by conceptual role `INSPECTOR` + active state).
2. **Call `Project.create(...)`** — the entity-method on the `Project` domain type (new this story; Story 2.1 left `Project` as a property bag). Signature per stack:
   - **.NET:** `public static Project Create(string code, string name, string? description, DateOnly startDate, DateOnly? targetCompletionDate, IReadOnlyList<Guid> tradeScopeIds, IReadOnlyList<Guid> inspectorIds)` — returns a new `Project` instance with `Id = Guid.NewGuid()`, `Status = ProjectStatus.Active`, `ComplianceScore = 100`, `CreatedAt = DateTimeOffset.UtcNow`, `UpdatedAt = DateTimeOffset.UtcNow`. The method also returns the populated `ProjectTradeScope[]` and `ProjectInspector[]` collections (either as out params, a tuple, or a wrapper record `CreatedProject(Project P, ProjectTradeScope[] Scopes, ProjectInspector[] Inspectors)` — match the .NET CLAUDE.md preferred shape; a `record` wrapper is idiomatic and avoids tuple shape leakage). Argument validation in the entity method: throw `ArgumentException` for empty/null required strings, `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` for `target_completion_date < start_date`, `ArgumentException` for empty `tradeScopeIds`. The handler catches these as "developer-error / shouldn't happen post-validation" — the request-level validation in AC4 catches user errors before the entity method is called.
   - **Django:** `@classmethod` `Project.create(cls, code, name, description, start_date, target_completion_date, trade_scope_ids, inspector_ids)` returning a `(Project, list[ProjectTradeScope], list[ProjectInspector])` tuple. Same argument-validation invariants raise `ValueError`.
   - **Go:** package function `func CreateProject(code, name string, description *string, startDate time.Time, targetCompletionDate *time.Time, tradeScopeIDs []uuid.UUID, inspectorIDs []uuid.UUID) (*Project, []ProjectTradeScope, []ProjectInspector, error)`. Same invariants return a wrapping error (`fmt.Errorf("%w: target before start", ErrInvalidArgument)`).
3. **Persist** the four row sets in this exact order, each within the same transaction:
   1. `INSERT INTO domain.project (id, code, name, description, status, start_date, target_completion_date, compliance_score, created_at, updated_at) VALUES (...)` — single row, all columns explicitly enumerated (no `INSERT INTO project DEFAULT VALUES`-style implicit columns).
   2. `INSERT INTO domain.project_trade_scope (project_id, trade_type_id) VALUES ...` — one row per submitted `trade_scope_id`. Per-stack ORM-native multi-row insert (EF Core `AddRange + SaveChanges`, Django `bulk_create`, pgx `CopyFrom` or batched `INSERT`).
   3. `INSERT INTO domain.project_inspector (project_id, user_id) VALUES ...` — one row per submitted `inspector_id`; zero rows if none submitted (the multi-select allows empty per AC1 §form-field-name-list).
   4. **`append_audit_entry()`** with `action="ProjectCreated"`, `actor_id=<request user id>`, `entity_type="Project"`, `entity_id=<new project id>`, `project_id=<new project id>`, `before_state=null`, `after_state=<canonical JSON per AC1 §12>`. The helper is the one introduced by Story 2.2 ([FieldMark.Data/Auditing/AuditAppender.cs](../../FieldMark/FieldMark.Data/Auditing/AuditAppender.cs) / [fieldmark_py/audit/services.py](../../fieldmark_py/audit/services.py) / [fieldmark-go/internal/data/postgres/auditstore.go](../../fieldmark-go/internal/data/postgres/auditstore.go) — verify the exact paths from Story 2.2's file list before invoking).
4. **Commit** the transaction. On any DB error inside the transaction (e.g. UNIQUE constraint on `project.code` racing against a concurrent submission, see AC4 §code-uniqueness), the entire transaction rolls back — no orphan trade-scope or inspector rows, no orphan audit entry.
5. **Respond** HTTP 200 with the **HX-Redirect** response header set to `/projects/<new-project-id>`. Per HTMX 4.0 behavior, this triggers `window.location = '/projects/<id>'` on the client. The response body is **empty** (or a one-line comment for human debugging — `<!-- redirect: see HX-Redirect header -->`). Do **not** also render the Project Detail partial in the body — HTMX honors the header and replaces the location regardless of body.
6. **For non-HTMX requests** (no `HX-Request` header — e.g. a no-JS form submission with HTMX disabled or the browser stripped JS), respond HTTP 303 See Other with `Location: /projects/<id>` and an empty body. The `303` choice (not 302) follows the canonical "POST → redirect → GET" pattern preserving the GET method on the follow-up. A per-stack test asserts both behaviors: `HX-Request: true` → HTTP 200 + `HX-Redirect`; no `HX-Request` → HTTP 303 + `Location`.

**And** the persistence order matters for FK integrity but **not** for transaction isolation — all four writes are in the same transaction so partial commits are impossible. Documented for code review: the order is "project → joins → audit" because the join tables FK to project, and the audit row's `project_id` requires the project row exist within the transaction's visible state (which it does, since same-tx writes are visible to subsequent reads in the same tx per Postgres MVCC).

**And** a per-stack integration test asserts:
- After a happy-path POST, `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM domain.project WHERE id = $newId` returns 1.
- `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM domain.project_trade_scope WHERE project_id = $newId` returns the submitted scope count.
- `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM domain.project_inspector WHERE project_id = $newId` returns the submitted inspector count (0 if none).
- `SELECT action, before_state, after_state FROM domain.audit_entry WHERE entity_id = $newId AND entity_type = 'Project'` returns one row with `action='ProjectCreated'`, `before_state IS NULL`, and `after_state` matching the canonical JSON shape from AC1 §12 (parse the JSONB and assert keys + values; do not byte-compare because Postgres may reorder JSONB keys internally — assert structurally).
- The `compliance_score` is `100` (the DDL default; the application did not pre-compute it).
- The `status` is `'Active'`.
- `created_at` and `updated_at` are within ±5 seconds of `now()` (the test's "now") — sanity check that the columns were populated.
- The audit row's `occurred_at` is within ±5 seconds of the project's `created_at` — same-transaction commit-time should make these effectively identical.

### AC4 — `POST /projects/` validation: 422 with re-rendered form + per-field error wiring

**Given** I submit invalid input — any one of the validation failures listed below
**When** the handler processes the request
**Then** the response is HTTP 422 with the **re-rendered form partial** carrying:

1. **An InlineAlert at the top** of the form with `role="alert"`, severity `danger`, title `"Couldn't create the project"`, message `"<n> errors must be resolved before this project can be created."` (substituting the actual error count). If Story 2.4 is `done` at implementation time, render the alert via `<partial>` / `{% include %}` / `{{template}}` of the `inline_alert` wrapper passing `severity="danger"`; if Story 2.4 is not yet `done`, render the canonical InlineAlert markup inline per [fieldmark_shared/components/inline_alert/canonical.html](../../fieldmark_shared/components/inline_alert/canonical.html) (which Story 2.4 will create) — and note in dev notes that the inline copy will be refactored to a wrapper invocation once 2.4 lands. A grep guard in code review verifies the eventual refactor.
2. **Each invalid field** carries `aria-invalid="true"` and `aria-describedby="<field-id>-error"`. Each invalid field is followed by `<p id="<field-id>-error" class="form-error" role="alert">{{message}}</p>` — the inner `role="alert"` is on the per-field message; it works in concert with the top alert (the top alert is the summary; per-field alerts are the details).
3. **Failed input values are echoed back** — the user does not have to re-type `name`, `description`, etc. `<select multiple>` values are re-selected via `<option selected>`. **Exception**: if the failed validation is "trade_scope_id <X> does not exist", the failed UUID is dropped from the re-selection set with an inline error explaining "Trade type was removed; please reselect". This is the only field where input is silently sanitized; document in code-review.
4. **No state changes** — the transaction did not open (or opened and rolled back). A per-stack test asserts that after a 422, `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM domain.project` is unchanged from before the request; `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM domain.audit_entry WHERE entity_type = 'Project'` is unchanged.
5. **No OOB swaps** — UX Pattern 3 prohibits OOB regions updating on a failed action. The response body contains only the re-rendered form partial. A per-stack test asserts the 422 response body does **not** contain `hx-swap-oob` attributes (grep assertion).

**Validation failure cases — each one MUST be tested per stack:**

| Case | Trigger input | Expected error field(s) | Expected error message (English; user-visible) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Empty code | `code=""` | `code` | "Code is required." |
| Whitespace code | `code="   "` | `code` | "Code is required." (trimmed input is empty) |
| Code too long | `code` = 33-char string | `code` | "Code must be 32 characters or fewer." |
| Code disallowed chars | `code="abc!"` | `code` | "Code must contain only uppercase letters, digits, and hyphens." |
| Code starts with hyphen | `code="-PROJ"` | `code` | "Code must start with a letter or digit." |
| **Code already in use** | `code="EXISTING"` matching a row already in `domain.project` | `code` | "A project with this code already exists." Per-stack handler catches the DB UNIQUE-constraint violation (Postgres SQLSTATE `23505`) and surfaces this error gracefully — see Dev Notes §"Uniqueness race condition" |
| Empty name | `name=""` | `name` | "Name is required." |
| Name too long | `name` = 201-char string | `name` | "Name must be 200 characters or fewer." |
| Description too long | `description` = 10001-char string | `description` | "Description must be 10,000 characters or fewer." |
| Missing start_date | `start_date=""` | `start_date` | "Start date is required." |
| Unparseable start_date | `start_date="not-a-date"` | `start_date` | "Start date must be a valid date (YYYY-MM-DD)." |
| Target before start | `start_date="2026-06-01"`, `target_completion_date="2026-05-01"` | `target_completion_date` | "Target completion date must be on or after the start date." |
| Unparseable target_completion_date | `target_completion_date="bad"` | `target_completion_date` | "Target completion date must be a valid date." |
| No trade scope | `trade_scope_ids=[]` | `trade_scope_ids` | "At least one trade scope is required." |
| Unknown trade scope UUID | `trade_scope_ids=["<random-uuid>"]` | `trade_scope_ids` | "One or more selected trade types are no longer available. Please reselect." |
| Inactive trade scope | `trade_scope_ids=["<uuid-of-inactive-trade>"]` (set `active=false` in test fixture) | `trade_scope_ids` | Same message as unknown UUID — do not leak that the row exists but is inactive |
| Unknown inspector UUID | `inspector_ids=["<random-uuid>"]` | `inspector_ids` | "One or more selected inspectors are no longer available. Please reselect." |
| Non-inspector role | `inspector_ids=["<uuid-of-user-with-non-inspector-role>"]` | `inspector_ids` | Same message — do not leak that the user exists but lacks role |
| **Multiple errors at once** | Empty code + missing start_date + empty trade_scope_ids | all three | All three fields show their respective per-field errors; the top alert says "3 errors must be resolved..." |

**Per-stack test:** parametrize over the 18 cases above. Each case asserts (a) HTTP 422, (b) the response body contains the specified error message text, (c) the specified field carries `aria-invalid="true"`, (d) `aria-describedby` points to a `<p>` whose `id` matches and whose text contains the error message, (e) the top InlineAlert is present with `role="alert"`. The multi-error case additionally asserts the error count in the top alert text is correct.

### AC5 — Authorization: `project.create` permission, 403 for unauthorized

**Given** Story 1.12 introduced the `can(actor, action)` primitive with a per-stack role-to-permission table
**When** I inspect each stack's permission table
**Then** the `project.create` permission is added to the table with the following grants:

| Role | `project.create` | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `ADMIN` | granted | per epic AC text "initially `ADMIN`" |
| `PROJECT_MANAGER` (PM) | **not granted in MVP** (deviation from epic AC narrative — see Dev Notes §"PM grant deferral") | The epic AC story narrative says "PM or Admin" but the explicit AC line specifies "initially `ADMIN`". Permissions are conservative; the PM grant can be enabled in a later story without rework — the wire-up is a single table row |
| `COMPLIANCE_OFFICER` | not granted | read-heavy role; not a creator |
| `SITE_SUPERVISOR` | not granted | scope is corrective actions, not project lifecycle |
| `EXECUTIVE` | not granted | read-only |
| `INSPECTOR` | not granted | scope is inspection execution |

The per-stack edits are:
- **.NET:** add a row / entry to the `can()` primitive's permission map for `(ADMIN, "project.create")` → `true`. The map's location is wherever Story 1.12 placed it — search `FieldMark/FieldMark.Web/Authorization/` or `FieldMark/FieldMark.Web/Services/` for the existing primitive.
- **Django:** add to the Django-Group-keyed permission set wired via custom permissions in Story 1.12 (search `fieldmark_py/auth_app/` or wherever Story 1.12 wired the role-group conventions).
- **Go:** add the role-to-permission constant in the Go primitive's map (search `fieldmark-go/internal/web/middleware/authz.go` or `internal/auth/` per Story 1.12).

**And** the `GET /projects/new` handler invokes `can(actor, "project.create")` before rendering; on `false`, returns HTTP 403.

**And** the `POST /projects/` handler invokes the same check; on `false`, returns HTTP 403 (FR7). **No state leakage**: the 403 response body is byte-equal to the canonical 403 body from Story 1.11 — assert by per-stack test that the 403 body for `/projects/new` (GET) and `/projects/` (POST) match the same canonical body byte-for-byte (after the standard normalization).

**And** if the user is **unauthenticated** (no session cookie), the existing Story 1.11 redirect-to-login middleware fires first — both routes redirect to `/login?return_url=/projects/new` (for GET) or `/login` (for POST — POST return-targets are not supported per Story 1.11's open-redirect resolution). A per-stack test asserts the unauth GET produces a 302 / 303 to `/login?...` and the unauth POST produces a 302 / 303 to `/login` (POST without return-url).

### AC6 — Method-not-allowed: GET against `/projects/` returns 405

**Given** the canonical HTTP-method matrix (AC1 §10)
**When** I make `GET /projects/` (no trailing path beyond the slash)
**Then** the handler returns HTTP 405 Method Not Allowed with the `Allow: POST` response header (or framework-equivalent — Django and Fiber both emit `Allow`; .NET's `StatusCode(405)` + manual `Response.Headers.Allow = "POST"` produces the same).

**Important**: the project list at `GET /projects` (no trailing slash) is **Story 2.9**, not this story. This story registers ONLY `POST /projects/` (with trailing slash). If `/projects/` (slash) and `/projects` (no slash) are treated as different routes by the framework, the `GET /projects` route MUST 404 (or whatever the framework's default is for an unregistered route) — **do not** preemptively register a list route here. A per-stack test asserts: `GET /projects/` (slash) → 405; `GET /projects` (no slash) → 404 (the absence-of-route signal Story 2.9 will fill in). If a framework normalizes the slash forms (e.g. some Go routers redirect slash↔no-slash), document the framework behavior and adjust the test — but do not change framework behavior to satisfy this AC.

**And** the response body for the 405 is **empty** or a one-line `405 Method Not Allowed` — do not render a full HTML page (frameworks default to a minimal response; that's fine). The `Allow` header is the actionable signal.

### AC7 — `make parity`: route inventory shows `GET /projects/new` and `POST /projects/` on all three stacks

**Given** the cross-stack route-parity tooling from Story 1.3
**When** I run `make parity` from the repo root
**Then** the route inventory diff is **clean** — `GET /projects/new` and `POST /projects/` appear in all three stacks' route dumps; no other new routes appear (the stub `GET /projects/<id>` from §scope-boundary is NOT a new route if Story 2.11's stub is already counted; verify against the Story 2.9 / 2.11 baseline before assuming). `pg_indexes` diff is zero (no DB changes this story — schema is owned by Story 2.1 / 2.2).

### AC8 — Component edge-case checklist coverage (per [component-edge-case-checklist.md](../../docs/reference/component-edge-case-checklist.md))

This story is a **handler story**, not a markup-only component story, but the form rendering still benefits from the nine-category walk. Applicable categories:

**Given** category 1 (unknown enum / vocabulary values)
**When** a form submission contains a `trade_scope_ids` UUID not present in `domain.trade_type`, or contains an `inspector_ids` UUID not matching the `INSPECTOR` role-and-active filter
**Then** the validator returns 422 with the documented message (AC4 §unknown-trade-scope-UUID / §unknown-inspector-UUID). The fallback is a friendly "Please reselect" — not a 500, not a crash, not silent omission of the invalid UUID. Per-stack test for each.

**Given** category 6 (text overflow & special characters)
**When** the form receives XSS-prone characters in `name`, `description`, or `code`
**Then** the framework-default auto-escaping covers the round-trip (matching the Story 2.4 / 2.5 / 2.6 / 2.7 pattern). A per-stack test asserts `name="<script>alert(1)</script>"` round-trips as `&lt;script&gt;alert(1)&lt;/script&gt;` in the 422 re-rendered form (where the value is echoed back into the input's `value` attribute). The DB write is unaffected (parameterized queries — Postgres treats the bind value as data, not SQL). `code` cannot contain XSS-prone characters per AC4 §code-disallowed-chars (the pattern allowlist rejects `<`, `>`, etc.); test for the disallowed-char path explicitly.

**Given** category 9 (empty / whitespace text input)
**When** `code="   "` or `name="   "` (whitespace only)
**Then** the validator trims and treats as empty per AC4 §whitespace-code / §empty-name. Per-stack test.

**Given** categories 2 (font load), 3 (JS init), 4 (AG Grid), 5 (stacking), 7 (reduced motion), 8 (forced colors)
**When** I evaluate against this story's deliverables
**Then** they are **N/A** or covered by prior-story defenses:
- **2:** No new font references.
- **3:** Form is zero-JS-required. HTMX progressive enhancement is the only JS dependency; HTMX disabled → form falls back to standard `method=post action=...` submit (no degraded behavior).
- **4:** Not AG Grid.
- **5:** No queueing.
- **7:** Story 1.14 global rule covers.
- **8:** Story 1.14 global rule covers form controls; verify `.form-error` styling has a non-color signal (an icon or text-weight differential paired with the red color) — if Basecoat's default `.form-error` is color-only, add a paired `<svg aria-hidden="true">` warning icon to the canonical form-error markup. Per-stack snapshot test asserts the icon is present.

### AC9 — Security-defaults checklist coverage (per [security-defaults.md](../../docs/reference/security-defaults.md))

Walked the seven categories — **multiple** apply because this is a form-handling story:

**Given** category 3 (strict allowlist validation on writes) — **the central security control of this story**
**When** the handler processes any user-controlled write
**Then**:
- `code` passes the `^[A-Z0-9][A-Z0-9-]*$` regex check before any DB query touches it.
- `trade_scope_ids` and `inspector_ids` UUIDs are validated to exist + be active + (for inspectors) hold the `INSPECTOR` role, before the inserts. The validation read and the write are in the **same transaction** with row-level locking on the trade-type rows (`SELECT ... FOR SHARE` if the framework supports it cleanly, otherwise rely on the FK constraint at INSERT time — see Dev Notes §"Validate-then-write race"). If `FOR SHARE` is hard to express in the framework's ORM idiom, accept the FK as the final guarantee: a row deleted between read and write produces an FK violation, which the handler treats as the "trade type was removed" 422 case (re-using the same code path as AC4 §unknown-trade-scope-UUID).
- Free-form text (`name`, `description`) is length-capped before any DB write per AC4.
- The validated values are persisted; the raw input is NOT.

**Given** category 6 (CSRF posture)
**When** the form POSTs
**Then**:
- **.NET:** the page uses `[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]` on the POST handler (or the global filter if Story 1.6 / 1.11 wired one). The hidden input `__RequestVerificationToken` is in the form. Per-stack test: POST without the token → 400 (.NET default for CSRF failure).
- **Django:** the form carries `csrfmiddlewaretoken` (`{% csrf_token %}` in the template). The Django CSRF middleware validates. Per-stack test: POST without token → 403 (Django default).
- **Go:** ADR-012 exempts Go from CSRF middleware in this MVP phase. The Go handler does NOT validate a CSRF token. The Go base-layout template does NOT include a CSRF hidden input. Document this in the form-contract doc (AC1 §6) and in the Go stack's CLAUDE.md if the existing Story 1.6 / 1.11 CSRF section needs updating. **Per-stack test for Go**: assert the form does NOT contain a CSRF hidden input (negative assertion documenting the exemption).

**Given** category 1 (open-redirect on return-target parameters)
**When** I evaluate the redirect target
**Then** **N/A** — the success redirect target `/projects/<id>` is server-decided (the new project's id is server-generated UUID); the `return_url` pattern from Story 1.11 is NOT used here. No user-controlled redirect target exists in this story's surface.

**Given** categories 2 (cookie attributes), 4 (dynamic RegExp), 5 (filesystem writes), 7 (stub-auth warnings)
**When** I evaluate against this story's deliverables
**Then** they are **N/A** — no new cookies (auth session cookie from Story 1.7 / 1.8 / 1.9 is reused; no preference cookies set), no dynamic regex on user input (the `code` allowlist regex is a literal string per stack: C# `[GeneratedRegex(...)]`, Python `re.compile(r"...")`, Go `regexp.MustCompile(...)` — all compiled once at module-load, not per-request, not from user input), no filesystem writes, the stub-auth warning from Story 1.9 fires at app startup not per-request.

### AC10 — Cross-stack architecture principle three-deliverable check (root [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md))

This story introduces **one cross-stack contract** — the project-create form: routes, field names, return-target convention, audit-emission shape — and produces all three deliverables:

1. **Documentation contract:** `docs/reference/project-create-form-contract.md` (AC1) — the new NEW doc this story creates.
2. **Native implementation per stack:** per-stack handler + Razor page / Django view+template / Go handler+template + `Project.Create` entity method + permission-table grant. No shared codec, no generated stubs.
3. **Per-stack conformance test:** the integration tests covering AC2 form rendering, AC3 happy path, AC4 422 validation (parametrized over 18 cases), AC5 403, AC6 405, AC8 edge cases, AC9 security defaults. Per-stack snapshot tests on the form's rendered shape (focused on the field-name and label-id-association invariants — not byte-equality of the entire form, since the form-shape latitude rule in AC1 §5 explicitly allows per-stack rendering differences for the multi-selects).

**And** the cross-stack E2E (one happy-path Playwright scenario per stack, executed against each stack's running dev server with seeded ADMIN credentials, asserting: login → navigate to `/projects/new` → fill form → submit → land at `/projects/<id>` with the new project's name in the heading) is the FR65 commitment — this story does NOT introduce a new Playwright per-stack scaffold; it adds three scenarios to the existing Story 1.11 / 1.13 cross-stack suite. If that suite's directory structure was resolved by Story 2.6 (e2e fixture page), reuse the convention.

### AC11 — Build, type, lint, and test gates green on every stack

- **.NET:** `cd FieldMark && dotnet csharpier check . && dotnet build && dotnet test && dotnet test FieldMark.Tests.Integration/FieldMark.Tests.Integration.csproj` — clean. New tests: `ProjectsCreatePageTests.cs` (page-render + permission + 405), `ProjectsCreateHandlerTests.cs` (POST happy path + 18-case 422 + 403 + audit assertion + uniqueness race), `ProjectCreateEntityMethodTests.cs` (unit tests on the `Project.Create` static method).
- **Django:** `cd fieldmark_py && uv run ruff check . && uv run mypy . && uv run pytest && uv run pytest -m integration` — clean. New tests: `projects/tests/test_create_form.py` (parametrized over the 18 cases + happy path + audit assertion + 403 + 405).
- **Go:** `cd fieldmark-go && make check && go test ./... && go test -tags=integration ./...` — clean. New tests: `internal/web/handlers/projects_create_handler_test.go`, `internal/domain/entities/project_create_test.go`.
- **`fieldmark_shared`:** `cd fieldmark_shared && pnpm install && pnpm run build` — clean. No changes to `src/` (no CSS edits this story); `dist/fieldmark.css` byte-identical after build.
- **E2E:** the three new per-stack happy-path scenarios pass in CI against each stack's running dev server.
- From repo root: `make parity` exits 0 (AC7) and `make test-all` exits 0.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 4: .NET form + handler** (AC: #2, #3, #4, #5, #6, #8, #9, #11)
  - [ ] 4.1 Create `FieldMark/FieldMark.Web/Pages/Projects/Create.cshtml` (Razor page) and `Create.cshtml.cs` (page model) with `OnGetAsync` (renders form, 403 / 302 paths), `OnPostAsync` (validates input via `[BindProperty]` model + `ModelState` checks + DB lookups, calls `Project.Create`, persists in a single `IDbContextTransaction`, calls `IAuditAppender.Append`, returns `StatusCode(200)` with `HX-Redirect` header on success or returns the page with 422 status code on failure).
  - [ ] 4.2 Page-model input class with `[Required]`, `[StringLength]`, `[RegularExpression]` data annotations matching AC4. Custom `IValidatableObject` for cross-field rules (`target_completion_date >= start_date`).
  - [ ] 4.3 Wire the `Allow: POST` 405 on bare-collection GET per AC6.
  - [ ] 4.4 Tests: `ProjectsCreatePageTests.cs` (page-render, 403, 405), `ProjectsCreateHandlerTests.cs` (POST happy path, 18-case 422, audit assertion, uniqueness race, CSRF posture), `ProjectsCreateE2ETests.cs` if the Story 1.11 / 1.13 Playwright host is .NET — otherwise the cross-stack E2E spec adds .NET coverage at Task 7.
  - [ ] 4.5 Run `dotnet csharpier check . && dotnet build && dotnet test && dotnet test FieldMark.Tests.Integration/` — clean.

- [ ] **Task 5: Django form + view** (AC: #2, #3, #4, #5, #6, #8, #9, #11)
  - [ ] 5.1 Create `fieldmark_py/projects/views.py` with `project_create_view` function-view (or class-based `View` with `get` / `post` methods); decorate the GET function with `@require_GET` and the POST function with `@require_POST` and `@login_required` and a custom `@permission_required("project.create")` decorator (or per-Story-1.12 idiom).
  - [ ] 5.2 Create `fieldmark_py/projects/forms.py` with `ProjectCreateForm(forms.Form)` containing the seven fields per AC1 §5 with per-field validators. Custom `clean()` for cross-field validation.
  - [ ] 5.3 Create `fieldmark_py/templates/projects/create.html` rendering the form. Top-of-file comment references the contract doc.
  - [ ] 5.4 Wire the URL in `fieldmark_py/projects/urls.py` (create the file if absent — Story 2.1 mapped models but may not have introduced the URL conf for this app) and include it from `fieldmark_py/fieldmark/urls.py`.
  - [ ] 5.5 Tests: `fieldmark_py/projects/tests/test_create_form.py` parametrized over 18 cases + happy path + 403 + 405 + audit assertion + uniqueness race + CSRF posture.
  - [ ] 5.6 Run `uv run ruff check . && uv run mypy . && uv run pytest && uv run pytest -m integration` — clean.

- [ ] **Task 6: Go form + handler** (AC: #2, #3, #4, #5, #6, #8, #9, #11)
  - [ ] 6.1 Create `fieldmark-go/internal/web/handlers/projects_create_handler.go` with `GetProjectsNew` and `PostProjectsCreate` Fiber handlers.
  - [ ] 6.2 Create `fieldmark-go/internal/web/templates/pages/projects_create.html` rendering the form. Top-of-file comment references the contract doc.
  - [ ] 6.3 Register the routes in the Go router (search `internal/web/routes.go` or `cmd/server/main.go` for the existing route table). Wire the auth middleware (Story 1.9 stub auth + Story 1.12 `can` check).
  - [ ] 6.4 Validation: a `validateProjectCreate(input ProjectCreateInput) ([]ValidationError, *Project, []ProjectTradeScope, []ProjectInspector)` function returns either a list of errors or the prepared entity + collection slices. Per-stack idiom: use `errors.Is` + sentinel `ErrInvalidInput` for the entity-method side, separate validation surface for the request-shape side.
  - [ ] 6.5 Persistence: open a `pgx.Tx` via the existing `ProjectStore` interface (extend per AC3 §Go) — add `CreateInTx(ctx, tx, *Project, []ProjectTradeScope, []ProjectInspector) error` to `ProjectStore`. The audit append uses Story 2.2's `AuditStore.Append(...)`.
  - [ ] 6.6 Tests: `internal/web/handlers/projects_create_handler_test.go` (happy + 18-case 422 + 403 + 405 + audit assertion + uniqueness race). No CSRF tests (Go is exempt per ADR-012).
  - [ ] 6.7 Run `make check && go test ./... && go test -tags=integration ./...` — clean.

- [ ] **Task 7: Cross-stack Playwright E2E happy path** (AC: #10, #11)
  - [ ] 7.1 In the existing E2E suite (Story 1.11 / 1.13 / 2.6 resolution), add one `project-create-happy-path.spec.ts` that runs against each stack's running dev server. Login as ADMIN → GET `/projects/new` → fill the form → submit → assert URL transitions to `/projects/<uuid>` → assert the project's name renders in the destination page's heading (or in a recognizable place — match what the Project Detail stub from §scope-boundary returns).
  - [ ] 7.2 Use the existing seeded ADMIN dev user from Story 1.10. The trade-type and inspector-user fixtures should already exist post-Story-2.3 (reference-data read API). Pick the first two trade types and the first inspector user.
  - [ ] 7.3 The test asserts no JS console errors throughout the flow (`page.on('pageerror')` / `page.on('console')`).

- [ ] **Task 8: Cross-stack parity verification** (AC: #7, #10, #11)
  - [ ] 8.1 Run `make parity` from repo root. Route diff shows `GET /projects/new` and `POST /projects/` in all three stacks; no other new routes. `pg_indexes` diff zero.
  - [ ] 8.2 Run `make test-all`. Green.
  - [ ] 8.3 Verify the contract doc Component Index / cross-references resolve (the form-contract doc is the new artifact; verify the per-stack handler files cite it; verify the doc's links to handler files resolve).

- [ ] **Task 9: Story sign-off** (AC: all)
  - [ ] 9.1 Populate the Sign-off block below; flip sprint-status to `review`.

## Dev Notes

### Critical context (read before writing code)

- **This is the first real CRUD story of Epic 2.** Stories 2.1 / 2.2 mapped tables and provided helpers. Stories 2.4–2.7 produced markup-only components. **2.8 is the first story that writes domain rows in response to a user action.** Everything before this was scaffold; this is where the system starts to *do things*. The audit-on-every-mutation contract (FR39) and the 422-renders-in-place pattern (UX Pattern 3) get their first real workout here; downstream Epic-2/3/4/5/6 stories will copy this story's transaction shape. Get it right.
- **The transaction shape is the canonical reference for the rest of the project.** Every state-changing handler from here to Story 6.5 follows the same five steps: validate → load reference rows in the transaction → call the entity method → persist domain writes → append audit entry → commit → respond. Document this shape in the form-contract doc's "Why" section so future-readers see the pattern.
- **`HX-Redirect` is the right tool here, not partial swap.** A brand-new entity does not have an in-page partial container — the destination is a separate screen. The non-HTMX fallback (303 + `Location`) ensures the no-JS browser still works. Resist the temptation to fold the new project's detail partial into the response body; HTMX honors `HX-Redirect` over body anyway, so the body would just be wasted bytes.
- **Code allowlist rationale (`^[A-Z0-9][A-Z0-9-]*$`).** Project codes are short identifiers like `BLDG-A-2026` or `RENOV-NORTH`. The allowlist:
  - Excludes lowercase letters (forces uppercase for visual identification — codes are quoted in talk-tracks and on radios).
  - Excludes underscores (a stylistic choice — hyphens are common in industry; the codebase's hard-rules.md doesn't take a stance here, but `code` should not collide with the underscore-separated audit-action vocabulary or with snake_case DB columns).
  - Excludes whitespace (codes are quoted; whitespace breaks tabular display in AG Grid).
  - Excludes special characters (defense against future contexts where the code may appear in URLs, filenames, or log lines — `<`, `>`, `&`, `/`, `\` would all be friction).
  - Requires alphanumeric start (no leading hyphen — prevents shell / CSV / arg-parser confusion).
  The pattern is permissive enough to not block legitimate construction-project codes; if a user reports legitimate codes being rejected, the pattern is the one to revisit (not the other validations).
- **Uniqueness race condition.** Two simultaneous POSTs with the same `code` will both pass the pre-INSERT uniqueness check (each opens its own transaction; neither sees the other's pending INSERT until commit). One will INSERT successfully; the other will hit the UNIQUE constraint violation on `domain.project.code` at INSERT or commit time (Postgres SQLSTATE `23505`). The handler MUST catch this specific exception and surface AC4's "A project with this code already exists." error — not as a 500. Per-stack:
  - **.NET**: catch `DbUpdateException` with inner `PostgresException.SqlState == "23505"`. Map to ModelState error on `Code`.
  - **Django**: catch `django.db.IntegrityError` and inspect the message / `__cause__`; or use `Project.objects.filter(code=code).exists()` inside the transaction (works because the SELECT sees the not-yet-committed concurrent INSERT? — no, MVCC visibility says it does NOT; this approach is racy too. The integrity-error catch is the only reliable mechanism). Map to form `add_error('code', ...)`.
  - **Go**: inspect the returned error via `errors.As(&pgErr)` and check `pgErr.Code == "23505"`. Map to ValidationError on `code`.
  A per-stack integration test forces the race by opening two concurrent transactions and asserts both: one succeeds, the other gets 422 with the correct message.
- **Validate-then-write race for trade types and inspectors.** A trade type or inspector user could be deactivated between the validation read and the INSERT. The pure-database resolution: the FK constraint at INSERT time will fail if the row was hard-deleted (which we don't do — `active=false` is soft-delete). For soft-delete: the validation read filters by `active=true`, but the INSERT does NOT re-check the active flag at the DB level (there's no constraint for it). To close the race fully, the INSERT could be `INSERT INTO ... SELECT ... WHERE active = true` with a row-count check; this story does NOT introduce that complexity (the race window is microseconds; soft-delete is rare; the worst-case is a project ends up scoped to a just-deactivated trade type which is a recoverable state). Document the choice in the form-contract doc Change Procedure section.
- **The `Project.create(...)` entity method's signature returns the project + the join collections.** Why a wrapper / tuple rather than just `Project`? Because the join-row UUIDs (for `project_trade_scope` and `project_inspector`) are generated inside the entity method — letting the handler regenerate them or guess at them would leak the "always-PascalCase-snapshot" contract from `after_state`. The entity method owns the new ids; the handler is a pass-through to persistence.
- **ActionButton vs form-submit boundary.** UX-DR §"Affordance Trichotomy" applies to *action affordances* — buttons that fire `hx-post` for a single state-changing action. The form-submit button is a *different concept*: it's the user committing the form values they just typed. The trichotomy logic (`permission_false → absent; permission_true && state_allows_false → disabled-with-tooltip; both_true → present`) does not apply: by the time the user is staring at the create form, they've already passed the permission check (AC5 §GET-403). The submit button is a plain `<button type="submit">Create Project</button>`. Document this distinction in the form-contract doc's Why section so future stories don't reflexively reach for ActionButton.
- **PM grant deferral.** The epic story narrative says "PM or Admin can create" but the explicit AC text says "initially `ADMIN`". This story implements the explicit AC text (ADMIN only). Rationale: the conservative grant ships immediately; enabling PM is a one-line change in the permission table and a one-line test update. If/when the product accepts PM creation, the change is trivial. Recording this in the Sign-off block as a documented divergence from the epic narrative; the AC line is authoritative.
- **The 405 surface is brittle across frameworks.** Razor Pages, Django, and Fiber all handle method-mismatch differently. The form-contract doc records the expected behavior; per-stack tests assert against the framework's actual response shape (status code + `Allow` header). If a framework cannot produce 405 with `Allow` natively (e.g., a server-side router that 404s on method mismatch), the story may relax to "405 OR 404 with documented rationale" — but only after exhausting framework-idiomatic configuration. Do NOT introduce middleware just to convert 404 to 405; that's overengineering.
- **Snapshot-test latitude for forms.** Stories 2.4 / 2.5 / 2.6 / 2.7 used byte-equality snapshot tests on rendered markup. This story's form is more permissive — the multi-select for trade scope and inspectors may render as `<select multiple>` (Django, .NET) or as a list of `<input type="checkbox">` (Go, if the templating engine prefers). Snapshot tests assert (a) the canonical `name` attribute appears on an element of the appropriate type, (b) all reference-data rows render as options/checkboxes, (c) the form's accessibility wiring (label-for / id, required, aria-* on errors) is intact — but NOT byte-equality. Document this in code review.
- **Stub the Project Detail page if 2.11 is not yet done.** The redirect target `/projects/<id>` must respond with *something* for the E2E test to land. A minimal `GET /projects/<id>` handler per stack that returns `<main><h1>{{name}}</h1></main>` (server-rendering the project's name from a DB read) is the smallest possible stub. Document in Sign-off that the stub will be replaced by 2.11. Do not gold-plate the stub.

### Component-specific notes

- **Reference-data lookup for the multi-selects.** Story 2.3 introduced the read API for `domain.trade_type` (and the inspector users). Use it. Don't re-implement the reads here; the existing handler / store function should be called from the form-render handler. If the existing read function returns only `active=true` rows (which it should), the form's option list is correct by construction.
- **`description` is a textarea, not a rich-text editor.** Plain text, no HTML, framework auto-escape on render. If a future story wants rich-text descriptions, that's a separate story with its own XSS-defense AC.
- **`compliance_score` is the DDL default 100.** The `Project.create` entity method does NOT touch `compliance_score`; the DDL DEFAULT 100 supplies it. The `after_state` JSON snapshot includes `compliance_score: 100` as a literal because we want the snapshot to be self-contained (a future replay-from-audit-log feature would need the score in the snapshot). Same logic for `status: "Active"`.
- **`created_at` / `updated_at` are DDL defaults.** Same pattern — the columns have `DEFAULT now()`; the entity method does not set them; the EF Core / Django / pgx mapping must mark them as server-defaulted so they read back populated. This was wired in Story 2.1 — verify before assuming.
- **The form does NOT pre-fill any field on first GET.** No default code suggestion, no default name. Pre-filling would tempt users to leave defaults, which would cause weird project codes. Empty form is the right starting state.

### Edge cases (per [component-edge-case-checklist.md](../../docs/reference/component-edge-case-checklist.md))

See AC8. Categories 1, 6, 9 apply; 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8 are N/A or covered by prior-story defenses.

### Security defaults (per [security-defaults.md](../../docs/reference/security-defaults.md))

See AC9. Category 3 (allowlist validation) and category 6 (CSRF posture) apply. Categories 1, 2, 4, 5, 7 are N/A.

### Cross-stack contract three-deliverable check

See AC10. One contract surface; three deliverables: contract doc, three native handlers + entity methods + permission grants, per-stack conformance tests + Playwright E2E.

### Project Structure Notes

- The Razor `Pages/Projects/` directory may or may not exist post-Story 2.1 — Story 2.1 was data-layer-only. Create the directory.
- The Django `fieldmark_py/projects/` app exists (Story 2.1 mapped models there). Verify `urls.py` exists or needs creation; verify `views.py` exists or needs creation; verify the `templates/projects/` directory exists or needs creation.
- The Go `internal/web/handlers/` directory exists (Story 1.5 / 1.9 wired login handlers there). Pattern: one file per logical handler group; `projects_create_handler.go` is the canonical name.
- The Story 1.12 `can()` primitive file location varies per stack and per Story 1.12's resolution. Grep first; do not assume.
- The Story 2.2 `append_audit_entry` helper file location is documented in the Story 2.2 file list — refer to `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/2-2-...md` §"Files this story modifies vs creates" before invoking.

| Final review date | _pending_ |
| Total review rounds | 0 |
| Final reviewer verdict | _pending — story created, status `ready-for-dev`_ |

| Dev-notes divergences from epic AC | (1) The epic story narrative says "PM or Admin" but the AC text says "initially ADMIN" — this story implements the AC text. PM grant deferred per Dev Notes §"PM grant deferral". (2) The epic AC's "framework-equivalent" for 405 is implemented as actual 405 with `Allow: POST` header in all three stacks; framework-divergence escape hatch unused. (3) The form-contract doc is a NEW cross-stack artifact this story creates (per the root CLAUDE.md form-contract corollary requirement) — the epic AC list does not explicitly enumerate it, but the corollary in root CLAUDE.md ratified post-epic mandates it. |
